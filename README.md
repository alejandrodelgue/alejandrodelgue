### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My commitment and passion are focused on researching and studying carbon cycle regulators in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems,
and implementing them in mitigation and adaptation projects based on Natural Climate Solutions (NCS).
Additionally, I possess a strong interest in multi-scale carbon monitoring systems, which include methods such as fixed cameras for
flow estimation, Eddy Covariance towers, LIDAR tools, and satellite tools.

I have experience in monitoring carbon dynamics and water resources in various ecosystems, 
using a variety of methodologies that enable the understanding of ecosystem processes at different scales.
